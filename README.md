# Nuclear-Decay-Euler-Method
Calculating Nuclear Decay Numerically by Euler Method. Radioactive decay is the process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation. A material containing unstable nuclei is considered radioactive. Three of the most common types of decay are alpha decay, beta decay, and gamma decay, all of which involve emitting one or more particles.
